### 1. Descriptive Statistics

Understand the measures used to describe and summarize datasets. 

#### Central Tendency:
- **Mean**: Arithmetic average of the data.
- **Median**: Middle value when data is ordered.
- **Mode**: Most frequently occurring value(s).

#### Dispersion:
- **Range**: Difference between the maximum and minimum values.
- **Variance**: Average of the squared differences from the mean.
- **Standard Deviation**: Square root of the variance, indicating data spread.
- **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: Range of the middle 50% of the data.
- **Quartiles**: Values dividing the data into quarters.

#### Shape of Distribution:
- **Skewness**: Measure of asymmetry in the distribution.
- **Kurtosis**: Measure of the "tailedness" of the distribution.

### 3. Correlation & Association

Explore the relationships between variables through correlation and association techniques.  

#### 3.1 Correlation:
- **Pearson's Correlation**: Measures the linear relationship between variables.
- **Spearman's Correlation**: Non-parametric rank-based correlation.
- **Kendall's Correlation**: Ordinal association measure.

#### 3.2 Association:
- **Cross-Tabulation**: Summarizes relationships between categorical data.
- **Cram√©r's V**: Quantifies association strength for categorical variables.

### 4. Hypothesis Testing

Apply statistical hypothesis testing using parametric and non-parametric methods.  

#### 4.1 Parametric Tests:
- **One-Sample t-Test**: Compare a sample mean to a known value.
- **Two-Sample t-Test**: Compare means of two independent samples.
- **Paired t-Test**: Analyze means of paired samples.
- **Z-Test**: Evaluate proportions or large sample means.
- **F-Test**: Compare variances between groups.

#### 4.2 Non-Parametric Tests:
- **Mann-Whitney U Test**: Compare two independent samples.
- **Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test**: Analyze paired sample ranks.
- **Kruskal-Wallis Test**: Compare ranks across multiple groups.
