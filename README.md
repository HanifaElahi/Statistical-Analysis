# Statistical Analysis

This repository provides a structured exploration of statistical analysis concepts and methods. It covers a variety of statistical techniques, from basic central tendency measures to advanced hypothesis testing, implemented in Jupyter Notebooks.  

## Table of Contents

### 1. [Central Tendency Measures](https://github.com/HanifaElahi/Statistical-Analysis/blob/main/Life%20Expectancy%20(WHO)%20%7C%20Part%20I%20%7C%20Central%20Tendency%20Measures.ipynb)

Understand the measures used to represent the central value of a dataset
- **Mean**: Arithmetic average of the data.
- **Median**: Middle value when data is ordered.
- **Mode**: Most frequently occurring value(s).

### 3. [Correlation & Association](https://github.com/HanifaElahi/StatisticalAnalysis/blob/main/Life%20Expectancy%20(WHO)%20%7C%20Part%20III%20%7C%20Correlation%20%26%20Association.ipynb)

Explore the relationships between variables through correlation and association techniques.  

#### 3.1 Correlation:
- **Pearson's Correlation**: Measures the linear relationship between variables.
- **Spearman's Correlation**: Non-parametric rank-based correlation.
- **Kendall's Correlation**: Ordinal association measure.

#### 3.2 Association:
- **Cross-Tabulation**: Summarizes relationships between categorical data.
- **Cram√©r's V**: Quantifies association strength for categorical variables.

### 4. [Hypothesis Testing](https://github.com/HanifaElahi/Statistical-Analysis/blob/main/Statistical-Analysis%20Part%20IV%20-%20Hypothesis%20Testing.ipynb)

Apply statistical hypothesis testing using parametric and non-parametric methods.  

#### 4.1 Parametric Tests:
- **One-Sample t-Test**: Compare a sample mean to a known value.
- **Two-Sample t-Test**: Compare means of two independent samples.
- **Paired t-Test**: Analyze means of paired samples.
- **Z-Test**: Evaluate proportions or large sample means.
- **F-Test**: Compare variances between groups.

#### 4.2 Non-Parametric Tests:
- **Mann-Whitney U Test**: Compare two independent samples.
- **Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test**: Analyze paired sample ranks.
- **Kruskal-Wallis Test**: Compare ranks across multiple groups.
