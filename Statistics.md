## What is Statistics?

-Statistics is the branch of mathematics dedicated to the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data.
- At its core, it enables us to answer questions and solve problems based on numerical evidence.

The mathematical theories underpinning statistics rely heavily on:
- **Differential and Integral Calculus**: For continuous data analysis.
- **Linear Algebra**: For modeling relationships between variables.
- **Probability Theory**: To assess the likelihood of events and outcomes.

Whether you're analyzing trends, predicting outcomes, or making data-driven decisions, statistics is the backbone of these processes.

## Areas of Statistics

Statistics can be broadly divided into two main areas:

### 1. Descriptive Statistics

#### Purpose
Descriptive statistics help summarize and describe the main features of a dataset in a clear and understandable way.

#### Key Techniques
- **Measures of Central Tendency**: These summarize the center point of a dataset.
  - *Mean*: The average value.
  - *Median*: The middle value when data is ordered.
  - *Mode*: The most frequently occurring value.
- **Measures of Dispersion**: These indicate the spread or variability of the data.
  - *Range*: The difference between the highest and lowest values.
  - *Variance*: A measure of how far values are spread out.
  - *Standard Deviation*: The average deviation from the mean.
- **Data Visualization**: Using charts, graphs, and histograms to present data effectively.

#### Example Use Case
Analyzing the average monthly sales of a company over a year to identify trends and outliers.

### 2. Inferential Statistics

#### Purpose
Inferential statistics allow us to make predictions or generalizations about a larger population based on a sample of data.

#### Key Techniques
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Assessing claims about a population. Common methods include t-tests and chi-square tests.
- **Estimation**: Calculating parameters like confidence intervals to estimate population characteristics.
- **Regression Analysis**: Modeling relationships between variables (e.g., linear and multiple regression).

#### Example Use Case
Predicting election results based on survey data from a representative sample of voters.

## Types of Data in Statistics

Understanding data types is critical for choosing the appropriate statistical methods. Data can be categorized into two main types:

### 1. Quantitative Data (Numerical)
Quantitative data represents numerical values or amounts.

#### Subtypes
- **Continuous Data**: Can take any value within a range (e.g., height, weight, temperature).
- **Discrete Data**: Consists of distinct, countable values (e.g., number of employees, test scores).

#### Example
- Continuous: The height of students in a class (e.g., 5.4 feet, 6.2 feet).
- Discrete: The number of books in a library (e.g., 250, 300).

### 2. Qualitative Data (Categorical)
Qualitative data represents characteristics or categories.

#### Subtypes
- **Nominal Data**: Categories with no inherent order (e.g., colors, types of cars).
- **Ordinal Data**: Ordered categories, but differences between ranks are not meaningful (e.g., rankings, satisfaction levels).

#### Example
- Nominal: Gender of participants (male, female, non-binary).
- Ordinal: Customer satisfaction levels (satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied).

## Statistical Levels of Measurement

In statistics, data can be classified into four levels of measurement, each with distinct properties and implications for analysis:

### 1. Nominal-Level Measurement

#### Definition
Categorical data without any order or ranking.

#### Example
- The name of the U.S. president elected in 2020: *Joseph Robinette Biden Jr.*

### 2. Ordinal-Level Measurement

#### Definition
Data with a meaningful order, but the differences between values are not consistent or meaningful.

#### Example
- Rankings in a race: American *Fred Kerley* was the second-fastest man in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics based on 100-meter sprint times.

### 3. Interval-Level Measurement

#### Definition
Ordered data with meaningful differences, but no true zero point. This means ratios are not meaningful.

#### Example
- Inflation rates: Inflation hit *8.6% in May 2022*. The last time inflation was this high was *December 1981*.

### 4. Ratio-Level Measurement

#### Definition
Ordered data with meaningful differences and a true zero point, allowing for meaningful ratios.

#### Example
- Meteorological temperatures: The lowest recorded temperature was *-128.6 degrees Fahrenheit in Antarctica in 1983*.
